		"Tom\u00e1\u0161 N\u011bmec": "Tomáš is a kind IT technician who is obsessed with the murder of his half sister Emilie, six years ago.\n\nTomáš Němec is a 24-year-old IT technician whose life is dominated by solving the murder of his half sister, Emilie Němec. Emilie was stabbed in 2013 and the killer was never brought to justice.\n\nHe is Czech. He started studying computing at college but never finished the course. He is allergic to shellfish. He has a severe phobia of water.\n\nPhysically, Tomáš is in pretty good shape. He is average-height with light skin, red blond hair and blue eyes. Unusually, he has a prosthetic foot; a shark ate his.\n\nHe grew up in a working class neighbourhood. His mother left when he was young, leaving him with his father, who was a drunk.\n\nHe is currently single. His most recent romance was with a student called Eliška Musilová, who was the same age as him. They broke up because Eliška couldn't deal with Tomáš's obsession with Emilie's death.\n\nTomáš's best friend is an IT technician called Roman ﻿Svoboda. They are inseparable. He also hangs around with Miroslav Javorský and Soňa Šebková. They enjoy cycling together.",
