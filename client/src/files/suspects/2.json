		"Eliot Brousseau": "Eliot Brousseau is a 20-year-old French student who enjoys listening to music, social card games and praying. He is intelligent and careful, but can also be very rude and a bit grumpy.\n\nHe is currently at college. He is allergic to Brazil nuts and obsessed with bagels.\n\nHe grew up in a working class neighbourhood. He was raised by his mother, his father having left when he was young.\n\nHe is currently single. His most recent romance was with a journalist called Jeanette Langelier, who was 20 years older than him. They broke up because Eliot found Jeanette's political views too conservative.\n\nEliot's best friend is a student called Jaroslav Bílek. They get on well most of the time. He also hangs around with Stefan Ebersbacher and Ivana Mátlová. They enjoy checking news stories against the Czech Prime Minister together.",
